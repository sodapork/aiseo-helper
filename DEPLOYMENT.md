   - Vercel will automatically detect it's a Next.js project

3. **Connect Custom Domain**

   - Click "Settings" â†’ "Domains"
   - Add your domain: `aiseohelper.com`
   - Update your domain's DNS settings as instructed by Vercel

### 2. Netlify (Alternative - Free Tier Available)

### 3. Traditional Hosting (Shared Hosting)

For shared hosting providers like Bluehost, HostGator, etc.:

1. **Build for static export**
   ```bash
   # Add to next.config.js
   module.exports = {
     output: 'export',
     trailingSlash: true,
   }
   
   # Build
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Upload files**
   - Upload the contents of the `out` folder to your hosting provider
   - Point your domain to the hosting provider

## Domain Configuration

### DNS Settings

Once you have hosting, update your domain's DNS settings:

```
Type: A
Name: @
Value: [Your hosting provider's IP]

Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: aiseohelper.com
```

### SSL Certificate

Most modern hosting providers (Vercel, Netlify, etc.) automatically provide SSL certificates. For traditional hosting, you may need to purchase one.

## Environment Variables

If you add any API keys or environment variables later:

1. **Vercel**: Add them in the project settings
